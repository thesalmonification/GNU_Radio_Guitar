# GNU_Radio_Guitar
# Description
This project uses GNU Radio Companion to create digitial guitar pedals. I created 3 pedals for the guitar. They include: 
* Cosine Modulation (ie Tremelo)
* Delay
* Railing (ie Overdrive)

# Installation
The attached files can be simply run through the GNU Radio Companion GUI.


# Hardware
For my setup, I used a USB Soundcard, a pre-amp for my guitar, and 3 1/4" cables. Choosing the proper audio input/output allows audio to enter GRC processing, and be outputted to either computer speakers or a full-fledged guitar amp. I also believe the popular "Rocksmith" guitar cable should work with this system.
